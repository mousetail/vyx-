# What is this?

This is a attempt to compress vyxal code. It's a huffman tree compressor trained on 1500 Vyxal programs from [CSGE](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com).

Saves around 4-5 bytes on average (but with huge variability), does nothing most of the time. Occasionally make the program slightly longer.

# How do I run it?

## Collect your own data

If you want to collect your own data, you will need to set the `STACK_API_KEY` environment variable to your stack apps API key then remove the `if False` from `collect_data.py` and run it.

## Building a tree from the data

This depends on the `code_json.json` file created in the previous step. You could also chose to replace this with your own corpus.

You can then run `analize_data.py` to build a tree.

To visualize the tree you can use the command `dot -Tsvg graph.dot -o out.svg`. It's debatable whether this visualization is helpful.

## Use the data

The `encode_decode.py` will benchmark the encoding and produce the table like seen above. It will also make sure the enccoding is sane.

To use in your own script, use like this:

```py
from vyxÎ¼ import encode_decode

forest = encode_decode.load_forest()
encoded_string = encode_decode.bits_to_bytes(encode_decode.encode(string, forest))
```

For decoding use the same except inverse.
